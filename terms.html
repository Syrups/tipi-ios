        <h2>Enjoy Tipi</h2>
        
        <p>
        Although these Terms form a proper legal contract—and inevitably read like a proper legal contract—the bulk of them are simply designed to ensure our users have fun. These Terms let us provide and continue to improve our Services, while at the same time ensuring that a few mean users don’t ruin the fun for everyone else. Your part in that is simple. Just use common sense: Keep sending awesome photos to your friends, and please don’t send photos that they don’t want to receive.
        </p>
